          >Mathematics has always been a gateway for my understanding of the
          world.</strong
        >
        Since my childhood, I always wondered about patterns behind complex
        systems. I soon found mathematics as my direction to pursue this
        curiosity.
      </p>
      <h2>Academic Achievements</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          Euclid Contest (Distinction), AMC-12 (Honor Roll), AIME (score: 12),
          and Physics Bowl (Silver).
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        These achievements propelled me to uncover more about the depths of
        mathematics. Through these, I developed a love for analysis, inspired by
        books like <em>How to Think About Analysis</em> by Lara Alcock and
        concepts such as the Mean Value Theorem.
      </p>

      <h2>Exploring Beyond Mathematics</h2>
      <p>
        In A-level Further Mathematics, I learned to build and solve
        differential equations, inspiring me to explore multivariable calculus,
        the Jacobian matrix, and gradient vectors. I applied these in research
        optimizing fire station placements in a city. Through this, I explored
        the momentum gradient descent method, showcasing the real-world
        application of mathematics.
      </p>

      <h2>Financial Mathematics</h2>
      <p>
        My curiosity led me to financial mathematics, inspired by the binomial
        tree model and the Black-Scholes formula. Exploring Brownian motion and
        Ito processes fascinated me, bridging mathematics with real-world
        phenomena like asset pricing.
      </p>

      <h2>Extracurricular Passions</h2>
      <p>
        Outside academics, I enjoy performing arts and music. My achievements
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Regional first prize in a drama performance about the Long March
        </li>
        <li>First prize in the IPEA percussion competition</li>
        <li>Grade 10 certificate of drums</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Music analysis has also deepened my understanding of measure theory,
        enriching my appreciation of frequency distributions and auditory
        experiences.
      </p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        Mathematics is not just a subject for me; it is a mindset. It enables me
        to combine intuition with rigour, solve real-world problems, and explore
        fascinating models like those in finance. I look forward to pushing the
        frontiers of mathematical research alongside mentors and peers at
        university.
